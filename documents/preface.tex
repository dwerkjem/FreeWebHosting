    \item Freelancers and independent professionals who seek to demonstrate services through a self-built website.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope of the Document}

The scope of this document encompasses all phases of free website creation, placing primary emphasis on development tasks. It includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Planning and Requirements Gathering:} Defining purpose, target audience, content inventory, and user experience goals.
    \item \textbf{Technology Selection:} Comparing static site generators (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo), lightweight JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Vue, Svelte), or pure HTML/CSS approaches.
    \item \textbf{Development Environment Setup:} Installing and configuring free code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code), package managers (e.g., npm), and version control systems (e.g., Git).
    \item \textbf{Design and Layout:} Crafting responsive page layouts using free CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) or custom CSS methodologies (e.g., Flexbox, Grid).
    \item \textbf{Writing Code:} Authoring HTML templates, modular CSS, and JavaScript for interactive elements; structuring files and directories for scalability.
    \item \textbf{Content Management:} Incorporating markdown or other plain-text formats to author content, enabling straightforward updates without proprietary software.
    \item \textbf{Asset Optimization:} Compressing images, minifying scripts and styles, and lazy-loading resources to ensure rapid page load times on free hosting.
    \item \textbf{Testing and Debugging:} Utilizing free browser development tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Edition) and open-source testing frameworks (e.g., Lighthouse, ESLint).
    \item \textbf{Deployment Overview:} Brief discussion of free deployment platforms (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel), Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and basic DNS configuration for free custom domain services.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance and Updates:} Strategies for version control, content updates, security patches, and performance monitoring using free analytics tools.
    \item \textbf{Transition to Paid Services (Optional):} Guidelines for when and how to upgrade to a paid service for domain name registration, premium hosting, or advanced features, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Criteria for upgrading based on traffic, functionality requirements, or security concerns.
        \item Comparison of paid hosting providers and domain registrars.
        \item Migration steps from free to paid environments, ensuring minimal downtime.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
